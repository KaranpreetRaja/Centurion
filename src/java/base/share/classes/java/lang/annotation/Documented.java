/**
 * If the annotation {@code @Documented} is present on the declaration
 * of an annotation interface <i>A</i>, then any {@code @A} annotation on
 * an element is considered part of the element's public contract.
 *
 * In more detail, when an annotation interface <i>A</i> is annotated with
 * {@code Documented}, the presence and value of <i>A</i> annotations
 * are a part of the public contract of the elements <i>A</i>
 * annotates.
 *
 * Conversely, if an annotation interface <i>B</i> is <em>not</em>
 * annotated with {@code Documented}, the presence and value of
 * <i>B</i> annotations are <em>not</em> part of the public contract
 * of the elements <i>B</i> annotates.
 *
 * Concretely, if an annotation interface is annotated with {@code Documented},
 * by default a tool like javadoc will display annotations of that interface
 * in its output while annotations of annotation interfaces without
 * {@code Documented} will not be displayed.
