/**
 * Indicates that an annotation interface is automatically inherited.  If
 * an Inherited meta-annotation is present on an annotation interface
 * declaration, and the user queries the annotation interface on a class
 * declaration, and the class declaration has no annotation for this interface,
 * then the class's superclass will automatically be queried for the
 * annotation interface.  This process will be repeated until an annotation for
 * this interface is found, or the top of the class hierarchy (Object)
 * is reached.  If no superclass has an annotation for this interface, then
 * the query will indicate that the class in question has no such annotation.
 *
 * <p>Note that this meta-annotation interface has no effect if the annotated
 * interface is used to annotate anything other than a class.  Note also
 * that this meta-annotation only causes annotations to be inherited
 * from superclasses; annotations on implemented interfaces have no
 * effect.
